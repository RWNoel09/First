    <h1>Maps</h1>
    <p>The first mistake deals with an inappropriate use of scale. Scale is a main attribute of maps and is a measure of the 
    proportion between distances and sizes on the map and those on the area represented. This is expressed as a ratio and should
    be determined based on the map you want to show. A large scale map is better for smaller areas in higher detail and a small scale
    map would be better for larger areas in less detail. Choosing the correct scale is critical to displaying your map in an
    effective way.</p><br>
    
    
    <p>The second mistake can occur when making your map projection. A projection is the process of making a globe, or portion
    of it, fit into a flat picture. There is no completely accurate way to this, so no matter which transformation you choose
    some features of the globe will be distorted. Again, choosing which two features to portray accurately depends on the kind of map
    you wish to create. For example, a map aimed at displaying landmass may focus on shape and size. Transforming your map into
    an appropriate projection is essential to any meaningful map.</p><br>
