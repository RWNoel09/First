    <h1>Force Diagrams</h1><br>
    <p class="answer">My first dataset that could be represented using a force diagram comes from a website that offers data on
    the historical transactions of Bitcoin. A force diagram could illuminate a summary of the transactions made. Each node would
    represent a party in the Bitcoin transaction and each edge would represent an actual exchange of Bitcoin. This force diagram
    would show who owns and the most Bitcoin and which owners are doing the most transactions. It would be insightful to the creators
    and owners of Bitcoin.</p><br>

    <p class="answer">My second dataset is full of profile data for Twitter users. This includes 40k users and the people
    they follow. I feel like this might infringe on privacy rights, but it would make a great force diagram! Each node could
    represent a user and each edge would represent a "friend" connection. It would illuminate who has the most "friends" and 
    what kind of people they are "friending". It would be an interesting visualization of social dynamics.</p><br>

    <p class="answer">My last dataset includes electoral donations in Brazil. It gives data on parties giving donations and
    parties recieving donations. Each node would represent a party and each edge would represent the donation. This force diagram
    would iluminate who is giving the most money in electoral donations and who is recieving it. This would be particularly useful
    to Brazil because their electoral system is infamous for corruption.</p><br>
