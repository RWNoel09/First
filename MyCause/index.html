    <h1>My Cause</h1>
    <p>Growing up I have gotten used to hearing the stereotype that everyone in the business world
      acts in their own self-interests. That only the ones who behave without a moral compass are the 
      ones who succeed. Being a economics major myself and as someone who plans on entering the business world
      upon graduation, these claims trouble me. My cause is prove this stereotype wrong and behave morally as a
      business professional.</p>
    <p>The data I have provided below is a population analysis of low-to-middle income households in the state of New York.
      This data relates to one or more of the kinds of stereotypes I referenced above. For example, this data
      might either reflect or refute the claim that wealthy business owners abuse their workers by keeping their
      incomes low. If trends can be seen in the population analysis then it might indicate that such practices are going on.
