    <p class="question">Why is visualization effective?</p>
    <p class="answer">Our visual sense is our most developed sense. Cairo explains that "humans are evolved to be really fast at 
    detecting patterns and noticing exceptions." Meaning, if we can convey data with a visual appeal then our audience
    is more likely to understand it. Visualization makes it easy to condense and portray data in order to recognize trends.</p><br>
    <p class="question">What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</p>
    <p class="answer">Cairo lists many ways to visually encode data, such length, height, postion, area, angle, line weight, 
    hue, and shade. However, successful visualizations are often based in elementary tasks, or higher up on the "heirarchy of 
    elementary visual tasks. This sounds complex, but all it really entails is that your audience will understand your data easier
    if it makes effective use of simple tasks(postion and length along scales for example).</p><br>
    <p class="question">What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization?</p>
    <p class="answer">Cairo mentions two caveats to consider when building a visualization. Certain methods of encoding have their
    strengths and weaknesses. A visualization that enables to user to recognize overall trends(the graph on the left) might not be as effective for 
    making accurate judgements(the graph on the right). Secondly, we must be critical of which method of visualization we use. Just because a certain 
    visualization works for certain data, this does not mean it works for all data. There are always trade-offs in choosing
    the method of data visualization.</p><br>
