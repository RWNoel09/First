    <p>My first dataset comes from Kaggle and is titled "US Minimum Wage by State from 1968 to 2017". The dataset contains
    the minimum wage of all fifty US states over the time period, which will illuminate how the reward for labor has changed
    over time. Interestingly, the dataset has also calculated the 2018-equivalent dollar value of each minimum wage which facotrs in
     inflation and will allow the user to really grasp the value of this wage over time. I am hoping this dataset will show how
    the increasing prosperity of the US over time has been allocated among its citizens.</p><br>

    <p>My second dataset comes from FRED and is titled "Corporate Profits After Tax". The dataset contains two columns: date, and
    corporate profits. The dates span from 1947 to 2018 show how corporate profits have increased over time. I am hoping this dataset
    might illuminate how corporate profits have increased relative to income per person. To do this, I would need to find a second
    dataset showing the change in income per capita over time.</p><br>
