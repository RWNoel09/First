    <h1>Data Visualization with Animation</h1>
    <p>The data visualization I found is from slate.com and it depicts "Who is Fighting Whom in Syria". It utilizes both a click and hover feature.</p><br>
    <p>Although my visualization did not use d3, the same features would not be hard to implement using d3.
    The click feature would be implemented using the simple .on("click", function() {}) as one clicked on one of the boxes.
    The hover feature would not be difficult to implement either. Use .on("mouseover", function(d) {}) on one of the boxes.<p><br>
